Evaluating the impact of the flash mob on certain product metrics by comparing it with the generated data.

Maintaining and encouraging user engagement is a crucial task for a product like ours. To achieve this, our marketing team decided to organize a flash mob in the news feed. Participants were asked to create a post sharing an interesting fact about themselves and publish it with a hashtag. The three posts that received the most likes would win prizes.

The flash mob took place from 2025-01-17 to 2025-01-23.

My task was to evaluate the effectiveness of this event.
